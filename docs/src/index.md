# [Introduction](@id doc:Introduction)

[`QuantumToolbox.jl`](https://github.com/qutip/QuantumToolbox.jl) is a cutting-edge [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) package designed for quantum physics simulations, closely emulating the popular [`Python QuTiP`](https://github.com/qutip/qutip) package. It uniquely combines the simplicity and power of Julia with advanced features like GPU acceleration and distributed computing, making simulation of quantum systems more accessible and efficient. Taking advantage of the [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/) language features (like multiple dispatch and metaprogramming), [`QuantumToolbox.jl`](https://github.com/qutip/QuantumToolbox.jl) is designed to be easily extendable, allowing users to build upon the existing functionalities.

*__With this package, moving from Python to Julia for quantum physics simulations has never been easier__*, due to the similar syntax and functionalities.

# [Installation](@id doc:Installation)

!!! note "Requirements"
    `QuantumToolbox.jl` requires `Julia 1.10+`.

To install `QuantumToolbox.jl`, run the following commands inside Julia's interactive session (also known as REPL):
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("QuantumToolbox")
```
Alternatively, this can also be done in `Julia`'s [Pkg REPL](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/getting-started/) by pressing the key `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, and then type the following command:
```julia-repl
(1.10) pkg> add QuantumToolbox
```
More information about `Julia`'s package manager can be found at [`Pkg.jl`](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/).

To load the package and check the version information, use either [`QuantumToolbox.versioninfo()`](@ref) or [`QuantumToolbox.about()`](@ref), namely
```julia
using QuantumToolbox
QuantumToolbox.versioninfo()
QuantumToolbox.about()
```
