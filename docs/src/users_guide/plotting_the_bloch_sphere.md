## Introduction

When studying the dynamics of a two-level system, it's often convenient to visualize the state of the system by plotting the state vector or density matrix on the Bloch sphere.

In [`QuantumToolbox`](https://qutip.org/QuantumToolbox.jl/), this can be done using the [`Bloch`](@ref) or [`plot_bloch`](@ref) methods that provide same syntax as [QuTiP](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/guide-bloch.html).

## Create a Bloch Sphere

In [`QuantumToolbox`](https://qutip.org/QuantumToolbox.jl/), creating a [`Bloch`](@ref) sphere is accomplished by calling either:

!!! note "Import plotting libraries"
    Remember to import plotting libraries first. Here, we demonstrate the functionalities with [`CairoMakie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/explanations/backends/cairomakie.html).

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
b = Bloch()
```

which will load an instance of [`Bloch`](@ref). Before getting into the details of these objects, we can simply plot the blank [`Bloch`](@ref) sphere associated with these instances via:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

See the [API documentation for Bloch sphere](@ref doc-API:Bloch-Sphere) for a full list of other available functions.

## Add a single data point

As an example, we can add a single data point via [`add_points!`](@ref):

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
pnt = [1 / sqrt(3), 1 / sqrt(3), 1 / sqrt(3)]
add_points!(b, pnt)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

## Add a single vector

Add a single vector via  [`add_vectors!`](@ref):

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
vec = [0, 1, 0]
add_vectors!(b, vec)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

## Add a single quantum state

Add another vector corresponding to the ``|0\rangle`` state:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
z0 = basis(2, 0)
add_states!(b, z0)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

## Add multiple data

We can also plot multiple points, vectors, and states at the same time by passing arrays instead of individual elements via [`add_points!`](@ref), [`add_vectors!`](@ref), and [`add_states!`](@ref), respectively. Before giving an example, we can use [`clear!`](@ref) to remove the current data from our [`Bloch`](@ref) sphere instead of creating a new instance:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
clear!(b)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

Now on the same [`Bloch`](@ref) sphere, we can plot the three states via [`add_states!`](@ref) associated with the `x`, `y`, and `z` directions:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
x = basis(2, 0) + basis(2, 1)
y = basis(2, 0) + im * basis(2, 1)
z = basis(2, 0)
add_states!(b, [x, y, z])
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

!!! note "State normalization"
    The function [`add_states!`](@ref) will automatically normalize the given quantum state(s), while [`add_vectors!`](@ref) does not normalize the given vectors.

A similar method works for adding vectors:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
clear!(b)
vecs = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
add_vectors!(b, vecs)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

# Add lines and arcs

You can also add lines and arcs via [`add_line!`](@ref) and [`add_arc!`](@ref) respectively:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
add_line!(b, x, y)
add_arc!(b, y, z)
fig, _ = render(b)
fig
```

## Add multiple points

Adding multiple points to the [`Bloch`](@ref) sphere works slightly differently than adding multiple states or vectors. For example, lets add a set of `20` points around the equator (after calling [`clear!`](@ref)):

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
clear!(b)

th = LinRange(0, 2π, 20)
xp = cos.(th)
yp = sin.(th)
zp = zeros(20)
pnts = [xp, yp, zp]
add_points!(b, pnts)
fig, lscene = render(b)
fig
```

Notice that, in contrast to states or vectors, each point remains the same color as the initial point. This is because adding multiple data points using [`add_points!`](@ref) is interpreted, by default, to correspond to a single data point (single qubit state) plotted at different times. This is very useful when visualizing the dynamics of a qubit. If we want to plot additional qubit states we can call additional [`add_points!`](@ref) function:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
xz = zeros(20)
yz = sin.(th)
zz = cos.(th)
add_points!(b, [xz, yz, zz])
fig, lscene = render(b)
fig
```

The color and shape of the data points is varied automatically by [`Bloch`](@ref). Notice how the color and point markers change for each set of data. Again, we have had to call [`add_points!`](@ref) twice because adding more than one set of multiple data points is not supported by the [`add_points!`](@ref) function.

What if we want to vary the color of our points. We can tell [`Bloch`](@ref) to vary the color of each point according to the colors listed in the `point_color` field (see [Configuring the Bloch sphere](@ref doc:Configuring-the-Bloch-sphere) below). Again, after [`clear!`](@ref):

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
clear!(b)

xp = cos.(th)
yp = sin.(th)
zp = zeros(20)
pnts = [xp, yp, zp]
add_points!(b, pnts, meth=:m) # add `meth=:m` to signify 'multi' colored points
fig, lscene = render(b)
fig
```

Now, the data points cycle through a variety of predefined colors. Now lets add another set of points, but this time we want the set to be a single color, representing say a qubit going from the ``|0\rangle`` state to the ``|1\rangle`` state in the `y-z` plane:

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
pnts = [xz, yz, zz]
add_points!(b, pnts) # no `meth=:m`
fig, lscene = render(b)
fig
```

## [Configuring the Bloch sphere](@id doc:Configuring-the-Bloch-sphere)

At the end of the last section we saw that the colors and marker shapes of the data plotted on the Bloch sphere are automatically varied according to the number of points and vectors added. But what if you want a different choice of color, or you want your sphere to be purple with different axes labels? Well then you are in luck as the [`Bloch`](@ref) structure has many fields which one can control. Assuming `b = Bloch()`:

## Animating with the Bloch sphere

The [`Bloch`](@ref) structure was designed from the outset to generate animations. To animate a set of vectors or data points, the basic idea is: plot the data at time ``t_1``, save the sphere, clear the sphere, plot data at ``t_2``, and so on. The easiest way to animate data on the Bloch sphere is to use the `record` function provided by [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/). We will demonstrate this functionality with the following example: the decay of a qubit on the Bloch sphere.

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
# system parameters
ω = 2π
θ = 0.2π
n_th = 0.5 # temperature
γ1 = 0.5
γ2 = 0.2

# operators and the Hamiltonian
sx = sigmax()
sy = sigmay()
sz = sigmaz()
sm = sigmam()
H = ω * (cos(θ) * sz + sin(θ) * sx)

# collapse operators
c_op_list = (
    √(γ1 * (n_th + 1)) * sm,
    √(γ1 * n_th) * sm',
    √γ2 * sz
)

# solving evolution
ψ0 = basis(2, 0)
tlist = LinRange(0, 4, 250)
sol = mesolve(H, ψ0, tlist, c_op_list, e_ops = (sx, sy, sz), progress_bar = Val(false))
x = real(sol.expect[1,:])
y = real(sol.expect[2,:])
z = real(sol.expect[3,:])
```

To animate a set of vectors or data points, we use the `record` function provided by [`Makie.jl`](https://docs.makie.org/stable/):

```@example Bloch_sphere_rendering
b = Bloch()
b.view = [50,30]

fig, lscene = render(b)

record(fig, "qubit_decay.mp4", eachindex(tlist), framerate = 20) do idx
    clear!(b)
    add_vectors!(b, [sin(θ), 0, cos(θ)])
    add_points!(b, [x[1:idx], y[1:idx], z[1:idx]])
    render(b, location = lscene)
end
nothing # hide
```

```@raw html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline controls src="./qubit_decay.mp4" />
```

!!! note
    Here, we set the keyword argument `location = lscene` in the last `render` function to update the existing Bloch sphere without creating new `Figure` and `LScene`. This is efficient when drawing animations.
